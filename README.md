🏛️ Architect's Code Journal

Welcome! I am a Technical Architect & Mentor. This repository serves as a curated collection of my journey through software architecture, system design, and advanced coding patterns.
My goal is to bridge the gap between complex theoretical concepts and practical, scalable implementations. Here, I break down high-level architectural decisions into simple, maintainable code snippets that I share with my community on Social media.

🎯 Objective
The purpose of this journal is not just to host code, but to explain the 'Why' and 'How' behind architectural choices from a senior perspective.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Expertise
As a mentor and architect, my focus lies in building resilient systems using:
Tech Stack: Python, JavaScript, Databases, ML, API
Architecture Styles: Microservices, Event-Driven, Serverless
DevOps & Tools: Docker, CI/CD, Git
